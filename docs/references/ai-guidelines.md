## Purpose and Scope

This course promotes thoughtful AI tool usage to enhance learning and productivity while maintaining academic integrity. The guidelines ensure AI strengthens rather than replaces critical thinking and creativity.

## Definitions

**AI Tools** encompass:
- Large language models (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini)
- Code generation platforms (GitHub Copilot, AWS Kiro)
- AI writing assistants (Grammarly AI, QuillBot)
- Image or multimedia generation tools

**Traditional Research Tools** include Google Search, academic databases, and online resources, subject to standard citation requirements.

## 1. General Usage Policy

**Permitted Uses:**
- AI assistance for learning and assignments (unless restricted)
- Brainstorming, research, and skill development
- Transparent documentation of all AI usage

**Prohibited Uses:**
- Submitting AI content as original work without meaningful personal input
- Using AI during closed-book exams unless authorized
- In open-book settings, using screenshots or image processing when prohibited
- Bypassing core learning objectives through AI delegation

## 2. Course-Specific Restrictions

**Default Policy:** AI tools generally permitted unless stated otherwise

**Restricted Contexts:**
- Quizzes and examinations (advance notice required)
- Assignments designated "AI-restricted"
- Final projects (AI as support only; transparency essential)
- Peer assessments and group work (specific policies apply)

Students must review assignment instructions and seek clarification when uncertain.

## 3. Assignment Guidelines and Academic Integrity

### 3.1 Acceptable AI Assistance

Students may use AI for:
- **Language Enhancement:** Grammar, style, and clarity improvements
- **Research Support:** Topic exploration and source identification in early stages
- **Technical Assistance:** Code debugging, test case generation, proof-of-concept snippets, and tool-level details after independent design
- **Formatting and Organization:** Document structure, outlines, citation formatting

### 3.2 Unacceptable AI Usage

Violations include:
- **Direct Submission:** Presenting AI-generated work as original without disclosure
- **Substantial Replacement:** AI fulfilling essential requirements without meaningful personal contribution
- **Circumventing Learning:** Using AI for tasks central to learning objectives

### 3.3 The "Substantial Personal Contribution" Standard

Work must demonstrate:
- Original thinking and analysis
- Personal subject matter understanding
- Individual idea synthesis
- Student-driven design and problem-solving decisions

## 4. Documentation and Transparency Requirements

### 4.1 Citation and Attribution

Students must:
- **Acknowledge AI Usage:** Specify which tools were used and for what purposes
- **Cite AI-Generated Content:** Attribute direct quotations or substantial ideas as external sources
- **Maintain Academic Honesty:** Disclose AI support with integrity

**Suggested Attribution Format:**
- "This assignment used [AI Tool Name] for [specific purpose]. Final analysis is my own."
- Include timestamps and translation/formatting details when applicable

### 4.2 Development Process Documentation

Major assignments require incremental development evidence.

**For Written Work:**
- Use collaborative platforms (HackMD, Google Docs) with revision histories
- Provide multiple drafts across reasonable time intervals
- Document research, outline creation, and iterative revisions
- Retain visible progression timestamps

**For Code Projects:**
- Employ version control (GitHub, GitLab) with consistent commits
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages following best practices
- Show problem-solving evolution through iterations
- Document testing, validation, and debugging

**For All Assignments:**
- Submit reflection describing development process
- Note key challenges and resolutions
- Demonstrate learning growth and independent contributions

## 5. Enforcement and Accountability

### 5.1 Evaluation Criteria

Instructors assess:
- Process evidence of incremental development
- Original thinking demonstration
- Learning objective achievement
- Proper attribution and transparency

### 5.2 Violation Response

**First-Level Concerns:**
- Return assignments lacking development history for revision
- Request additional documentation or process explanation
- Allow resubmission with possible grade adjustments

**Serious Violations:**
- Primarily AI-generated work receives no credit
- Deceptive practices trigger formal academic integrity proceedings
- Repeated violations result in significant penalties, including final grade impact

### 5.3 Appeals and Clarification

Students may:
- Request instructor meetings to review evidence
- Provide additional development process documentation
- Seek guideline clarification for future work

## 6. Learning and Development Focus

Guidelines aim to:
- Supplement, not replace, critical thinking and skill development
- Develop professional AI tool usage standards
- Foster AI capabilities and limitations understanding
- Ensure assessments accurately measure competencies

## 7. Staying Current

As AI technology evolves, guidelines may be revised. Students must:
- Review updates before major assignments
- Seek clarification on uncertain AI usage
- Understand new tool applications

**Direct questions or concerns to the instructor before submission.**
